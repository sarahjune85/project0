# bird vs bread.

**[Play here!](https://sarahjune85.github.io/project0/)**

A nonsensical and pointless variant on Tic Tac Toe _(or 'Noughts & Crosses' for my Commonwealth gang)._

My first project for GA's Software Engineering Immersive.

## Made using:

HTML, CSS, & JavaScript/JQuery.

## How to play:

_Surely you have played this before..._

1. Each player can select the bird or bread token they wish to play as using the left & right arrows under the respective token.

1. Start the game by either pressing any key on your keyboard or clicking the **Start** button.

1. Winning the game is as simple as lining up 3 of your tokens first

1. The winner and the current score will be displayed when someone is victorious.

### On a win/draw:

Hitting **"Start"** will start another game with the current score & tokens intact.

### For when things aren't going your way:

Hitting **"Reset"** will clear both the tokens and the score.

## Things I wish I had added but didn't get around to:

1. Some sort of localStorage to store state.
2. A randomising player start to prevent player 1 winning constantly.
3. Dynamically generated board of any size.
4. Responsive container for mobile. Currently sort of playable but not ideal.
